# automated_tests

Helper methods and RSpec test for beginning to build out test suite of web app with database of funds search functionality.

BHHelper is a helper file written in Ruby with methods defined for navigating the web app using Selenium.
Some of those methods are used in the fundviewer_spec.rb, others are not.
This is a sample of what I have been working on as I build out the test suite for the web app at my current job.

Thank you for taking the time to check this out!
