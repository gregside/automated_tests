# automated_tests

This is a sample of what I have been working on as I build out the test suite for the web app at my current job.

BHHelper is a helper file written in Ruby with methods defined for navigating the web app using Selenium.
Some of those methods are used in the fundviewer_spec.rb, others are not.

Thank you for taking the time to check this out!
